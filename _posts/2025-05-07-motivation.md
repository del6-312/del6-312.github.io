### Project Focus

In this project, I'm going to be creating a simulation of blackjack. In this game simulation, the user will be granted with $1000 dollars at first, and the user can play until satisfied or until the user goes bankrupt. I found this to be a good challenge because there's many different little functionalities that I need to create so that the user experience doesn't feel to clunky or difficult.

### Why This Project 

Everybody finds themselves being bored in class sometimes, and most people would likely play a video game or go on social media in order to cure their boredom. However, I find myself playing a blackjack simulator online, losing fake digital money for most of the time (I have no idea why I play it so often). When the idea of the final project was introduced, I thought there was no better opportunity than now to create a blackjack simulation myself.

### What I Want to Learn

For this project, I really want to strengthen my use of data types. Data types have always surprised me because of how much they could be extrapolated in fascinating ways. I really want to explore this surprising and interesting part of extrapolating data types in this project. I don't really have a particular idea of how I'm going to encounter this in my project, but I'm always curious to find out more. Also, I would really like to focus on the design of my game to so that my game would seem like its running smoothly all the time (which probably isn't going to happen, but I'll at least try). It's going to take lots of troubleshooting and learning new information online, but I'm down to learn more.



### My Approach 

I think that I would dedicate my first half week to working on the chip system and the bank. I might have to spend even more time, but I'm hoping it would only take half a week. For the next 7 days, I'm going to work on the game itself. I'm going to make the dealing process, the value of the cards, splitting, and payout ratios function correctly. For the last half week though, I really plan on trying to make this blackjack game much more visual if possible. I'll probably have to learn lots off the internet, so it's probably going to be a lot of crammed learning.

### What's Next

Now, I need to start working on the chip system and the user bank. For this, I'm going to try to break down this part into multiple user-defined functions that handle different aspects of the total system. I'm going to figure out the chip system, how I'm going to have users give their inputs, and figure out how to correctly manage the user's bank, which should hopefully be quite simple.
