### What I Set Out to Do
I had to revise my future plans a little bit due to a time crunch. So, with my new plan, I decided to dedicate the next days as a days for working solely on the gameplay aspect, as there was a lot to cover. My main focus is to work on hitting, standing, and processing whether the dealer or the player won.

### What I Actually Did

So for today, I kind of diverted off task. Originally, all of my cards were completely text-based. But, I decided to switch everything up so that the cards would actually look like cards (Comparison shown below). This took up more time than I expected because creating the cards took some time and it also took time to switch up all of my indexing in my functions. All my functions originally looked at the first index of every card, but now I had to switch it so that it would look at the 11th index so that it could see the actual value of the card. Outside of that, I fixed up some other minor issues that I faced as a result of this aesthetic change. I also worked on the process of hitting in blackjack.

### What I Learned or Noticed

One thing that I learned from this experience is that I need to have all of my steps planned out very clearly before I start programming a function that's a small part of such a large final plan. I tried to program individual functions and then combine them all at once, but I noticed that issues occured. It wasn't because the functions themselves didn't work correctly, but it was more because they didn't work well with each other. Because of this, I noticed that I need to clearly plan ahead and even consider how different functions will work with each other.

### What's Next

I'm already pretty delayed on my progress for the mechanics of the game, so I really need to catch up on that. From now on, all of my work will solely be dedicated to the mechanics of the game (hitting, standing, evaluating, doubling down, or splitting).
