Instructions to play my game!

1. Follow this link to access my colab notebook for my project: [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SVcJYwaiz9kUGmU89egMMpUWSuOcAZ87?usp=sharing)  
2. When you're in the notebook, scroll all the way to the bottom cell (it will have `blackjack_simulate()` typed in)
3. Go to the runtime tab and press "run all" (If it tells you the notebook isn't authorized, just press run anyways)
4. Have fun playing blackjack! (P.S. if you don't know how to play blackjack, please google it up, as it will provide an explanation much better than I can provide.)

(If this doesn't work, then look in my github repository: ([Folder containing code file](https://github.com/del6-312/del6-312.github.io/tree/main/files)). From there you can download the file blackjack_final__.ipynb and upload it to google colab to access it.)
