Instructions to play my game!

1. Follow this link to access my colab notebook for my project: [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SVcJYwaiz9kUGmU89egMMpUWSuOcAZ87?usp=sharing)  
2. Create a copy of this notebook in order to run the cells yourself.
3. When you're in the notebook, scroll all the way to the bottom cell (it will have `blackjack_simulate()` typed in)
4. Go to the runtime tab and press "run all"
5. Have fun playing blackjack!

(If this doesn't work, then look in my github repository: ([Folder containing code file](https://github.com/del6-312/del6-312.github.io/tree/main/files)). From there you can download the file blackjack_final__.ipynb and upload it to google colab to access it.)
